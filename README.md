# Restaurant Table Management System

This project is a simple restaurant table management system that allows staff to:

- Assign guests to tables
    - Walk-in guests
    - Reservations
- Make reservations
- Place food orders for each table
- Track order totals
- Clear tables after customers leave

## Technologies Used

- React.js 
- JavaScript
- CSS 
- Vite
- Git and Github


## To Note

This assignement had a limited amount of time and usability was not the focus, but in the future, I would like to incorporate these features:

- Offer bigger tables for group option
- Offer option to erase reservations when completed
- Offer option to assign reservation to a specific Tables.
